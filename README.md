# StoreFront

Storefront helps you find, compare and discover products. Using a search bar, and information about SKUs from local retail businesses, it shoes you prices around you, and how to find them. For instance, If you're looking for a pair of pants, you can see various models, and once you select a specific item, you can see where it's cheaper, get more information, and even reserve the item you want using Passbook.

We built Storefront using tech like Xcode for iOS development, Sketch for design, and various other technologies for prototyping, and design. We also used APIs like Facebook, Twitter and the Walmart APIs and various others to make this project.
